High School Student Test Performance Score

Course: Digital Humanities 100

Instructor: Adam Anderson


# DigHum100

# Description: 
High School is a pivotal time in a student's life and will often determine the path a student wil take towards their future career through attending college.  However, college admissions are not easy and often require high gpa and test scores to be admitted. Through the dataset, Student Performance in exams, I used Machine Learning Algorthims to model and find factors that influence High School Test scores the most.

Methods I use include:
-Linear Regression
-Ridge Regression
-Lasso Regression
-Random Forest
-Principal Components Regression




# What you will find:
- Dataset = StudentPerformance.csv
- Jupyter Notebook = Dighum100.ipynb
- Final Storyboard = DH 100 Data Storyboard Channing week 4 - Page 1.pdf
- Final Poster = DH 100 Poster Final Version.pdf
- Final Presentation = Dig Hum Final Presentation.pdf
- Video = zoom_9.mp4


A# dditional Information on items above:
- Dataset: Has code written for data exploration
- Jupyter Notebook: will find my code and documentation after each line of code explaining what I did
- Storyboard: Created using LucidChart. Used to display results/finding and analysis

# Additional Information:
- Code will be in Python
- I'm currently working on a project analyzing a dataset about High School test scores. I will be using machine learning methods and visualizations with pandas for data analysis
- Updates will be posted every week
